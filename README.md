# Sspammer
> A text spammer for Windows.
***
# How to use it?
* At first, it will ask for the text you want to spam.
* Then it will ask for the delay after every text. Leaving the option empty will set it to zero, which means zero seconds of delay after every line. You can also place a decimal value. Setting it to zero is not Recommended.
* Then in the end, it will ask for how many lines do you want to spam. Leaving it empty will run it forever.
* After setting all of the options, quickly select where you want to spam within five seconds.
* Remember, you can always quit by holding the "End" key.
